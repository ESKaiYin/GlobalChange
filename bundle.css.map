He strongly believes that the only way to 'reset the earth' is to grow plants that can survive saltier conditions. He enjoys the warmth and has been caught trying to leave the dome without protective gear, claiming that 'a little sun doesn't hurt anyone'. \\n Kathleen Burnell (nee Terry): A botanist who believes that cyanobacteria are the way to fix things. She has a pool in a separate room in the back of the dome that she feeds daily. \\n Martin Burnell: A hardware engineer. Designed and built the dome due to the worries of his wife. Now maintains the dome and its everyday functioning. \\n Victor Barker: A plumber. He believes that if irrigation systems are set up correctly, then plants should grow more easily. He regularly goes outside of the dome to check on the pipes that are set up. \\n Vivienne Barker (nee Wu): A nature enthusiast. She has trees planted both inside and outside of the dome and works with Victor to keep her outside trees hydrated. She believes that planting a row of trees between each row of crops will help to provide shade and also will take up more salt from the soil.\", speaker: \"personD\"},\n\t\t{text: \"Ines maintains the main rooftop area of the dome. He has planted some plants that are more salt tolerant and before moving to the dome, worked with scientists gentically modifying crops to make them more salt tolerant. \\n Kathleen has her cyanobacteria pool. She feeds it with a nitrogen fertiliser every day in order to keep the cyanobacteria happy. \\n Martin collects oxygen from the outer edge of the dome and puts it into canisters using machines that he developed in the run up to entering the dome. These canisters are used for outside expeditions and must be worn in the rooftop garden in the unlikely case of a leak. \\n Victor spends most of the time within his study designing piping and how to get drip irrigation working with minimal equipment. \\n Vivienne, as a mother, spends time looking after her children but also spends some time in the rooftop garden making sure that her crops are growing. She also gets some help from Ines to get crops that don't take in his sections to try to grow in her section.\", speaker: \"personD\"},\n\t\t{text: \"The Rozema and Flowers paper 'Crops For A Salinized World' believes that, as the earth becomes saltier, we should adapt our main crops and eat crops that are more salt tolerant. Ines believes in this paper strongly and rejects the opinion that there are some flaws and biases. Kathleen is a bit sceptical about this and believes that it shouldn't be considered the only option. She knows that Ines thinks that her cyanobacteria pool is a waste of time but she continues to check up with Martin and has found that her yield of oxygen is normally similar or higher per unit than Ines'. However, she also realises that Ines' project creates edible food and so she has a lot of hope for Vivienne and Victor's projects. Victor and Vivienne try to stay out of Ines' way as he is known to not be very agreeable but they continue on with their projects as they want the future to be bright for their children. \\n Everyone within the dome has pledged to be vegetarian but they raise animals in a lower level of the dome in order to preserve some animal species. The animals that have survived in the wild are now adapted to the environment but the animals in the dome are domesticated. When the dome was built a well was also dug tapping into a brackish water source which is now used by all for their plants and is purified for consumption and other human use.\", speaker: \"personD\"},\n\t]\n\n\tfunction clicked() {\n\t\tif(count <= 5){\n\t\t\tif(dialogList[count] && dialogList[count].covered !== undefined) {\n\t\t\t\tcovered = dialogList[count].covered;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tcount = count + 1;\n\t\t}\n\t\tif(count >= 6) {\n\t\t\thideNext = true;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tfunction typewriter(node, {speed = 60}) {\n\t\tconst valid = (\n\t\t\tnode.childNodes.length === 1 &&\n\t\t\tnode.childNodes[0].nodeType === 3\n\t\t);\n\n\t\tconst text = node.textContent;\n\t\tconst duration = text.length * speed;\n\n\t\treturn{\n\t\t\tduration,\n\t\t\ttick: t => {\n\t\t\t\tconst i = ~~(text.length * t);\n\t\t\t\tnode.textContent = text.slice(0, i);\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t};\n\t}\n\n</script>\n\n\n<style>\n\t:global(body) {\n\t\tbackground-color: pink;\n\t}\n\n\n\t#nextButton {\n\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\tmargin-right: 0px;\n\t\tfont-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;\n\t\tfont-size: 16px;\n\t\tright: 0px;\n\t\tbottom: 0px;\n        z-index: 2;\n\t}\n\n\t#dialogBox{\n\t\tfont-size: 30px;\n\t\tfont-family: \"Roboto Mono\";\n\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\tposition: absolute;\n        left: 0px;\n\t\twidth: 60%;\n\t\tmargin-left: 20%;\n        z-index: 2;\n\t}\n\t.personA {\n\t\tcolor: lightgrey; \n\t\tbottom: 100px;\n\t}\n\n\t.personB {\n\t\tcolor: goldenrod;\n\t\tbottom: 30px;\n\t\t\n\t}\n\t.personC{\n\t\tcolor: white;\n\t\tfont-size: 40px !important;\n\t\ttop: 70px;\n\t\tbackground-color: #00000066;\n\t}\n\t.personD{\n\t\tcolor: white;\n\t\tfont-size: 20px !important;\n\t\ttop: 20px;\n\t\tbackground-color: #000000AA;\n\t\twidth: 80% !important;\n\t\tmargin-left: 10% !important;\n\t\ttext-align: left !important;\n\t\tpadding: 10px;\n\t}\n\n\t.hidden {\n\t\tdisplay: none;\n\t}\n\n</style>\n\n<Buttons\n\ton:B1={_=>count=7}\n\ton:B2={_=>count=8}\n\ton:B3={_=>count=9}\n\ton:B4={_=>count=10}/>\n\n<DomeImage></DomeImage>\n\n<BlackToWhite covered={covered}>\n</BlackToWhite>\n\n<button id=\"nextButton\" on:click={clicked} class:hidden={hideNext}>\n\tNext\n</button>\n\n{#each dialogList as dialog, i}\n\t{#if i == count}\n\t<div id=\"dialogBox\" class=\"{dialog.speaker}\">\n\t\t{#each (dialog.text.split(\"\\n\")) as line}\n\t\t\t<p \n\t\t\tin:typewriter \n\t\t\tout:fade>\n\t\t\t\t{line}\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t{/each}\n\t</div>\n\t{/if}\n{/each}",
